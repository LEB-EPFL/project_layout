**Note that the analysis script does not actually do anything.** It is only meant to show how to read data and produce output.

## Purpose

To peform a cluster analysis on localization data from Hela TRF2 knockdown experiments.

```console
python -m venv .venv

```

2. Run cluster.py from the project root directory:

```console
python experiments/analysis/2023-04-17-hela-trf2-clustering/cluster.py
```
